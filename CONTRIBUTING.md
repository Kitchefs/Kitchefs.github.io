# Contribution Guidelines

First of all, thank you for taking the time to read this, as it makes it much easier to regulate community activity on the repository. Keep in mind that we are human and may take a few days to get back to you, also keep in mind that we won't accept everyting, but don't let that stop you.

Kitchefs is an open-source, always ad-free, online cookbook, and to keep it running, community support is highly appreciated.

That being said, here are some ways you can help us, so that Kitchefs can continue to thrive in the future.
